# Angular Material Design
A set of UI components that follow the [Material Design Guidelines](https://material.io/guidelines/)

## Install
```sh
yarn add @material-design/angular
```
_or_
```sh
npm i -S @material-design/angular
```

## Usage

(More details coming soon)

### Styles
You must also include the css for the component which you can do per component,
or simply include the full stylesheet.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="node_modules/@material-design/angular/styles.css">
```

If using sass, you can import the sass directly from the src folder.
```scss
@import '~@material-design/angular/styles';
```
